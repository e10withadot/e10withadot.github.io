# Welcome to my site!
## Why does it look so unimpressive at the moment?
Because it is. I made this in a whim after Tumblr banned my blog. Once I have more time I plan to do a lot more, but at this stage it looks like garbage. Sorry about that. I'll probably add:
* examples of my many projects
* art i drew
* maybe some funny blog posts i dunno

## I don't trust anyone now
Tumblr's automod bots banned my blog, a blog that had years of my art in it. It was quite literally the only source i had left for some of my earlier works, and it was taken from me because some bot thought I was spamming. So, despite my account's restoration- my works are moving here. Even if GitHub bans this repo, I still have all the files stored locally. This is my best shot.

Anyways, if you guys want a laugh- the video below is the last thing I sent on Tumblr. I really thought Herlock Sholmes got me banned.
