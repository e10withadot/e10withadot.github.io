# Welcome to my site!
## Why does it look so unimpressive at the moment?
Because it is. I made this in a whim after Tumblr banned my blog. Once I have more time I plan to do a lot more, but at this stage it looks like garbage. Sorry about that. I'll probably add:
* examples of my many projects
* art i drew
* maybe some funny blog posts i dunno
## Tumblr are idiots and they banned me from their site for no reason.
I have been a Tumblr shill for so long and this is how they repay me. Disgusting. I don't wanna sign up to any other socials because the social media landscape is burning up as we speak, and frankly good riddance. Anyways, I got zero clue why they banned me, but it may just be this video down below. I assume they thought I was making a statement about Ukraine (I wasn't lol).
